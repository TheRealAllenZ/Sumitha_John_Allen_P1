**FB price analysis**

Short-term: Immediate effect

![FB price movement during the last week of June and beginning of July](Images/FB0607.png)

We can see that FB prices dipped ~8% on June 26, 2020 and again ~2% on July 02,2020 as a result of the boycott announcements by various companies. FB fell more than the SP during this period but also recovered immediately within next few trading seesions. 

*So we can consider taking positions in FB (short term) to benefit from price dips.*


## CONSUMER CYCLICAL SECTOR
* Higher Growth Consumer Sector
* Higher Volatility
* Associated with convenience items, cars, clothing, fashion, travel & entertainment

From correlation analysis: We see that stocks LULU, VFC, ETSY, LEVI had higher corr with FB and were more senitive to price movements compared to 2019 correlation.(*corr analysis in notebook*)

During this period, we can observe from the chart that most CC stocks prices closely followed FB prices. Which could mean that this sector is considerably dependent on FB for advertisment and sales. And boycott had a negative impact on the stocks in this sector.

On further analysis, we can observe that the consumer cyclical sector change in prices was in the 0.02% +ve/-ve range in 2019. But in 2020, the change has increased to range of 0.15% resulting from factors including FB boycott and COVID lockdown.



## CONSUMER DEFENSIVE SECTOR
* Steady Growth Consumer Sector
* Lower Volatility
* Associated with groceries, food, alcohol, and bulk commodities

Unlike the consumer cyclical, consumer defensive stocks prices were not very sensitive to boycott announcements which is attributable to nature of this industry. However, some stocks like TGT, PEP, CL, HSY, CLX had higher correlation with FB price movements compared to 2019.



## Other Sectors

We can observe that sectors like Healthcare, Tech, Finance and Mix (other) did not show significant correlation to FB price movement during the boycott period.

## Price-To-Sales Ratio 

Price-to-sales ratio will show a comparison of which companies are expensive within each sector. This information alongwith price movements will help in deciding the stock picks.

We can observe that in the consumer defensive sector *PEP* and *TGT* have low PTS ratio and higher corr with FB stock price.
Further, in the consumer cyclical sector *VFC* is a better pick than *ETSY or LULU* as VFC has a lower PTS ratio than ETSY and LULU.
